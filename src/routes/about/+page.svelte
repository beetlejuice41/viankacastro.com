                Baliksaya Competition - 2018 (Organized by…) Category: Fashion and Design
		-Within a span of weeks, I’ve worked with tailors from TESDA to create my vision from paper to runway. The brief asked designers to create something that would revolutionize or create the modern version of the Baro’t saya.
		-My work was awarded the Fashion Visionary Award by SOFA Design Institute, and later on was featured at The Podium Mall in Ortigas.
		-This project deepened my appreciation for the Filipino culture and hone my fashion designing skills at the same time.
